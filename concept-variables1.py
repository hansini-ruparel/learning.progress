#Variables: a named place in memory. Used to store data and retrieve it later using variable name
#Constants: fixed values such as numbers, strings etc. Value DOES NOT change
#Reserved Words: fixed keywords in a language like: if, else etc

#Example of a constant and a variable

a = 3.5
b = 4
c = float(input("Enter a number "))

print("Value of a ",a)
print("Value of b ",b+1)
print("Value of c ",c+1)

#in this case a - constant and b and c are variables. Reserved words are: print, float, input
